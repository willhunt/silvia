# Introduction

## The Workhorse

The espresso machine used is the ever popular [Rancillio Silvia](https://www.ranciliogroup.com/rancilio/silvia/silvia/), in this case v2.

It seems now that [Rancillio](https://www.ranciliogroup.com/rancilio/silvia-xl/silvia-pro/) are offering an updated version of the machine with PID temperature control, auto on/off and shot timer.

## Previous Builds
This project started off initially with little to no programming skills, implementing PID temperature control via Arduino and code forked from the [Bare Bones Coffee Controller](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/BarebonesPIDForEspresso/).

During participation is [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) computer science course on edX for the final project I created an Android app to control the machine on/off functionality through a bluetooth connection added to the Arduino using an HC-05. An orverview, submitted for the CS50 course can be seen on YouTube: [Shot Loop - CS50 Final Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONYSYvyxC4E).
