# Web Application
The web application allows remote operation of the machine, providing several benefits over the stock product:
* Remote on/off - turn on from bed on a Sunday morning
* Schedule on/off - pre-heat automatically before you get up for work
* View previous settings - visually tune the temperature controller or see a previous brew profile
* Change settings - change machine settings using a friendly interface
* View machine status - secondary to the onboard screen the machine status can be checked

The machine is still fully operational via the physical buttons. 

Below are some examples showing use of the web application. The site is hosted locally from the espresso machine, not over the web although this would be possible.

## Operation
The update interval here is 5 seconds so there is some apparent delay in visualizing the response to certain actions due to the slow update frequency.

## Scheduling
The machine can easily be scheduled to turn on and off at repeatable daily or weekly times.

## Sessions
A session is defined as a period between the machine being turned on and off. Between these times the machine state is recorded and can be viewed individually or together.

## Settings
Many settings are for tuning the temperature controller but the temperature and brew setpoints can also be set.
